## Introduction

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files over time. It is used by many developers to keep track of their code changes and collaborate with others. Git is also used by many companies to manage their codebase.

<summary><h3> üë®‚Äçüíª What is git?</h3></summary>

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to track changes in software code and coordinate work among multiple developers. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who developed the Linux operating system.

Here are some key aspects of Git:

1. **Version Control :** Git allows you to keep track of changes made to files in your project over time. It records every modification, addition, or deletion, enabling you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate effectively.

2. **Distributed :** Git is a distributed VCS, meaning that every developer working on a project has a complete copy of the entire codebase and its history on their local machine. This allows for offline work and provides redundancy in case of server failures.

3. **Branching and Merging :** Git encourages a branching workflow, where developers can create separate branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently. Branches can be merged back into the main codebase, enabling concurrent development without conflicts.

4. **Collaboration :** Git facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Changes made by different developers can be easily merged together, and conflicts can be resolved with Git's built-in tools.

5. **Remote Repositories :** Git allows you to create remote repositories, which act as central hubs for collaboration. Remote repositories can be hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, providing a platform for sharing code, managing issues, and facilitating collaboration among team members.

6. **Command Line and GUI :** Git provides a command-line interface (CLI) for executing Git commands, but there are also various graphical user interfaces (GUIs) available that offer a more user-friendly way to interact with Git.

7. **Open Source :** Git itself is an open-source project, and it has become one of the most widely used version control systems across different domains, not limited to software development.

By utilizing Git, developers can work more efficiently, track changes effectively, collaborate seamlessly, and maintain a reliable history of their codebase. It has become an essential tool in the software development industry, empowering teams to build better software together.

## intializing git

### 1. Create a new repository for new project

**Go to the project folder**

```bash
git init
```

### 2. If it is an existing project

**check if it is already a git repository**

```bash
git status
```

output : 

```bash 
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

**Then**

```bash
git init
```

output : 

```bash
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/username/.../project/.git/
```

*** Advance Intiallization ***

** initialize a git repository with a name
*Default name is .git and branch is master*
*This .git folder is hidden*

```bash
git init <name>
```

** initialize a git repository with a name and a brach and a description and a template and a shared

*As you nessary, you can use or not use these options*

```bash
git init <name> --initial-branch=<branch name> --description="<description>" --template="<template>" --shared=<shared>
```
